Onboarding and contributor start-here (short public pointer)
=========================================================

This repository is maintained by the Pact Community Organization. For onboarding, contributing guidelines, and developer resources please consult the canonical Pact repository and community resources:

- Canonical code & docs: https://github.com/kda-community/pact-5
- Deployment & community tools: https://tools.chainweb-community.org/ and https://chainweb-community.org/

Notes for maintainers
---------------------

- A local agent runbook and acceptance-test scripts are kept workspace-local and are intentionally not committed to organization repositories. If you are a maintainer and need the local onboarding artifacts, request them via an internal channel or run the workspace acceptance test locally.

If you want an expanded public onboarding guide to live here, say so and we will draft a maintainer-reviewed, public-safe `docs/ONBOARDING.md` that fits organizational policy.

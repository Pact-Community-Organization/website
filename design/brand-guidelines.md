# Pact Community Organization — Brand Guidelines (Draft v1)

This document defines the initial visual identity for the **Pact Community Organization** and the **pact-community.org** website.  
The purpose is to establish a familiar visual language that feels familiar to developers in the Pact ecosystem, while remaining distinct, neutral, and community-driven.

These guidelines are intentionally lightweight to support exploration in early iterations.

---

## 1. Brand Principles

### **Community-Focused**
Design should feel welcoming, open, and safe for newcomers.

### **Professional but Approachable**
Avoid over-corporate aesthetics; maintain credibility but feel human.

### **Aligned with the Pact ecosystem**
Color and tone should feel like “you are still within the broader Pact ecosystem.”

### **Accessible & Clear**
High contrast, readable typography, and simple layouts.

---

## 2. Logo (Temporary Phase)

Until the official Foundation logo is created, use this placeholder approach:

- **Text-only logo**  
  - Primary: `Pact Community Organization`  
  - Secondary short version: `KPCF`  
-- Use established gradient inspiration (pink → purple) for accent elements around the logotype, but **do not recreate any corporate K mark**.

This avoids copyright/brand confusion while maintaining familiarity.

### **Primary Font (Headings)**  
**Satoshi** or **Inter** (whichever is easier to self-host)

### **Secondary Font (Body Text)**  
**Inter** (fallback: Roboto, Arial, sans-serif)

### Font Recommendations
- Headline weight: **600–700**
- Body copy: **400–500**
- Avoid overly stylized fonts
- Keep spacing generous for readability

## 5. Tone & Voice

The Foundation’s voice should be:

- **Clear**: Use simple language, avoid jargon  
- **Educational**: Explain concepts patiently  
- **Neutral**: Do not take positions on project favoritism  
- **Supportive**: Make newcomers feel safe learning Pact  
- **Community-driven**: Uplift builders, highlight contributions

Do not:
- Oversell or hype  
- Sound corporate  
- Use aggressive marketing language  

---

## 6. UI Style Direction (High-Level)

### **Layout Principles**
- Clean and modular
- Generous spacing
- Use cards and containers to break content into readable sections
- Light motion (small fades, slides) but avoid heavy animations

### **Buttons**
- Rounded 6px–8px  
- Primary buttons use the gradient (pink → purple)  
- Secondary buttons use muted lavender outlines

### **Links**
- Underline on hover
- Gradient color text for primary links

---

## 7. Icons & Imagery

### **Icons**
- Prefer simple line icons (Lucide or Heroicons)

### **Illustrations**
- Optional but should:
  - Avoid mascots or anime styles
  - Use geometric/abstract shapes with gradient accents

---

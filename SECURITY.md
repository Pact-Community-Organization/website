# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it to the maintainers so we can address it promptly.

Suggested reporting steps:

- Open a repository issue and mark it with the `security` label (if the issue tracker supports private reports, use that).
- For sensitive reports, contact the maintainers directly. Replace `security@example.com` with the appropriate security contact for this project.

We will triage and respond to security reports as soon as possible.
